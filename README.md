# Fiseanna
A link to my [Repository](https://github.com/Majorkas/Fiseanna-render) for the project and then

The Website is hosted on Render [here](https://fiseanna.onrender.com/).


## Inspirations:
My main inspiration for building this website was my brother Harry and his Partner Ava, Harry being a photographer and Ava enjoying making arts and crafts so why not make them a website to advertise and possibly sell these items so thats what I have began to create for them all of the current items are just advertising prints of photographs Harry has taken as Ava is still in the process of making the items she wants to post on the site. The name came from her Grandparents, FÃ­seanna the Irish word for visions.

## Design:

### Static Site

The font I decided to go for I chose for the main reason of it being a kind of celtic vibe making it match the theme I was trying to go for being Irish made prints and crafts with the motto being 

>Handmade crafts and prints, made with Ireland and its surrounding beauty at the forefront of its creation

this then also influenced the colour choices going for the greens and light colours. 

The main banner image is a beautiful photo my brother took while out walking so I decided to make that the main center piece of the whole site being at the top of every page with the main logo, motto and main nav elements.

### Flask Site:

When converting the static site to a flask app I decided to keep the same design as I had already put alot of thought into it and was happy with how it looked so I just kept the same css structure, made some small changes and additions to the html and added jinja templating to make it more dynamic and easier to manage.


## JavaScript:

### Static Site:

I have added a few interactive elements to the page using all of the skills learned in the last few weeks in module 2 breaking it down page by page we have

### 1. Universal:

The first of all interactivity I made was the menu button for the main nav element I had no major issues creating this as it was a simple DOM manipulation to toggle the class on both the motto and the actual nav elements to alternate between being hidden and not.

### 2. Index Page: 
This was my first challenge I wanted to create an image gallery with one main image and a few smaller ones that once hovered or focused on with mobile it would swap the smaller image to the main display making it bigger and easier to see, what gave me trouble was I couldnt get the small image to swap I used the forEach to take an array of image id's and srcs and then add event listeners to each for each kind of event I wanted and that seemed to work as i added a console log to display the src of the image i was hovering on and it displayed the correct src for each image my problem was when I then created the imgSwap function I couldnt for the life of me figure out why it wouldn't work but after trouble shooting for a few evenings I realised I had been trying to overcomplicate it completely and finally I realised it was simply just a matter of declaring a const for the main image and then writing the function to take that const and get the src using .src and taking the imgSrc gotten from the hover event listener and applying it to the main image src while being hovered then writing another function to apply the original image src back onto it

### 2.5. Success Page

I had no real challenges to face in the making of this page its a very basic redirect page that once you submit the form on the index it sends you to this page and then onload runs a function that that after 6 ticks it will send the user back to the index page while also displaying a countdown on the page 
```
let count = 6;
function redirectPage() {
  count--;
  document.getElementById('countDown').innerHTML = count;
  if (count == 0) {
    window.location = 'index.html';
  }
}
```

### 3. Store Page:
On the store page in the footer I decided I wanted to make a shipping calculator for the possible customers but for it i didnt want them to have to click a submit button everytime they selected the area they wanted to ship to I wanted it to dynamically update the price and location onto a span as the selection was changed without a submit button my main challenges with this was getting it to do exactly that without a button I thought I had the right code but after many failed attempts it turns out my problem with it was that I had the even listener attached to the drop down input which for some reason when listening for the change event it wasnt working so after trying to change many different thing I finally moved the event listener to look for changes on a div surrounding the drop box which fixed the issue of it not updating when changed a mistake I have now learned from and wont make again.<br>
The fixed listener:
```
document.getElementById('shipping-calculator').addEventListener('change', () => shippingCalcultor(address))
```
 but other than this small problem everything else I managed with ease 

### 3.5. Store Item Pages:

On this page I created a form that when submitted it would dislay the price of a print and gave the options for size and if the user wanted to add a frame for a set price I took some inspiration for this from the ready reckoner code we built in one of our lectures using the outputToSpan function and having one main function that would run everything to give the final result outputting the chosen values into the span element my only issue with this one was trying to get the drop down selection to change the price but I finally fixed it by changing the if else to look for the actual text in each selection of the drop down rather than the value. I enjoyed using the 

```
const FRAME = addFrame ? WITH_FRAME : NO_FRAME;
```
making the code alot shorter rather than having to do another if else.
I then repeated it so that when the user had the add frame selection checked it would swap the main image displaying the item to the framed image and when its not selected it would choose the non framed image.

### Flask Site: 
When converting the static site to a flask app I decided to keep all of the same interactive elements as I was happy with how they worked and looked so I just copied the js file over and linked it in the base.html file so that it would be on every page, I did make a few minor additions to the JS file to add the redirect for the account creation to instead of redirecting to the index it redirects to the Store page with the login form so that the user can log in straight away without any extra steps.


## Jinja:

In the Original static page I just used pure html but when I converted it to a flask app I had the chance to start using Jinja templating which made it so that I could condense the store pages down to one html file and using render template in flask I was able to input the correct image, title and alts for each different page depending on which route the user had taken to get there. I also used Jinjas base template to make a base.html file which contained the main nav element and head of most of the pages, the redirect pages for sending a message or creating an account excluded as I saw no need for a nav bar on these pages as the page would automatically redirect the user back to where I wanted them to be. Jinja was a great help with the store page element and helping me to make the site as a whole alot more dynamic and easier to manage.

## Python/Flask:
Python and Flask as a whole have been a massive help to really make the site come alive and be more than just a static site, I have been able to use flask to create routes for each of the pages and then using render template to send the user to the correct html file and also inputting variables into the html files using jinja templating.

It also allowed me to move away from the api on the homepage to a form that would write the users message and details in a text file(Not saving at the moment but hoping I moved in the right direction for once we start to get into databases) and then still being able to redirect it to the correct success page after submission.

The biggest addition I think with the move to python and flask was being able to create a simple account creation and login system storing the users username and password in a dict and then also storing the username in the session so that I could use that username to create a personalised welcome message using random.choice to select a random message from a template list.

One finaly thing I wanted to add after doing some reading about Flask is to add a custom 404 error page so that if the user tries to access a page that doesnt exist it will redirect them to a custom 404 page with a way back to the index of the site rather than just a blank page with a 404 error message making the user have to find the index page themselves.

## Closing Thoughts: 
Overall I am very happy with how the site turned out, I think it is easy to navigate around, I am also very happy with how the move to flask went and I think I have a good understanding of how flask works and how to use it to make a more dynamic site. In the future I would like to add a few more features such as a shopping cart and a checkout system but for now I am happy with what I have achieved.
